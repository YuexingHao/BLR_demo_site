          <p style="font-size:66%;text-align: left;">A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. 

            <br><br>At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient’s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords. The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time — including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes — was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation. One week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell “world” backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine.</p>

          <p style="font-size:66%;text-align: left;">A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study. Three years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements. Two years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity. Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep — including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams — continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours. The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles). Dr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3–C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1). Dr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient’s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated. The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea–hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation. On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably. In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient’s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation. A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors. Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence. However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient’s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep. A diagnostic test was performed.</p>

          <p style="font-size:66%;text-align: left;">“Mrs. G,” a 35-year-old married mother of three healthy children, including a newborn, was referred to the inpatient obstetric unit for management of an acute onset of fever. She had been diagnosed as having postpartum psychosis and had been hospitalized on the psychiatric unit for the past 16 days after a postpartum psychotic episode.

          <br><br>Mrs. G previously worked as a journalist but had been unemployed for several years. Her medical history was marked by two similar episodes of agitation, confusion, and mystic delusions starting on day 3 after each delivery, which required her immediate transfer to a psychiatric hospital and treatment with antipsychotic medication. The outcome of each episode was favorable, with a weaning from antipsychotics within 4 to 6 weeks postpartum and no psychiatric symptoms between episodes. Mrs. G reported no medical family history and denied use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs. The current episode began suddenly on postpartum day 3. Although midwives initially reported only an anticipatory anxiety focused on the possible recurrence of postpartum psychosis, by midday they noticed an increased level of anxiety and a mild obnubilation (mental clouding). Within hours, Mrs. G became confused, agitated, and violent, and verbal contact with her quickly became impossible as she aimlessly shouted her husband's name while trying to leave her room. After placement of physical restraints and an intramuscular injection of loxapine (100 mg), the patient was immediately transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Initial medical reports indicated normal results on physical examination and laboratory tests (complete electrolyte panel, CBC, liver function tests, and ECG).

          <br><br>On postpartum day 16, Mrs. G presented with fever (40°C [104°F]) and leukorrhea. Endometritis was suspected. On readmission to the obstetric ward, her treatment included risperidone (2 mg/day), alprazolam (1.5 mg/day), the phenothiazine antipsychotic cyamemazine (62.5 mg/day), and the anticholinergic tropatepine (10 mg/day). Antibiotic treatment was started to treat a possible infection.

          <br><br>Unlike in her previous postpartum episodes, Mrs. G's mental status responded only partially to antipsychotic treatment. A liaison psychiatry consultation was requested. The liaison psychiatrist found a mildly agitated and disoriented young woman who had wet herself and was circling around her bed. The patient was logorrheic, and her speech, which was mostly incoherent, revealed memory impairment. Strikingly, this mild state of confusion fluctuated during the interview, confirming midwives' reports of hourly changes in the patient's behavior. Mrs. G anxiously expressed feelings of guilt toward her newborn and the belief that her diagnosis of postpartum psychosis made her less able to take care of her children. She displayed no anger toward her children and no ideas of persecution, infanticide, or suicide. She also expressed the belief that “God talks to humankind through premonitory dreams or providential meetings,” a claim that had previously been interpreted as a mystic delusion. However, it appeared that this view was part of her cultural and religious background, as was later confirmed by her husband, who reported that she had held this belief for a long time and that it was shared by her relatives.

          <br><br>Overall, Mrs. G was more confused and less delusional than one would have expected in a typical postpartum psychosis. Puzzled by this clinical picture, the psychiatrist reconsidered the diagnosis of postpartum psychosis and extended his examination to assess the differential diagnosis. He found that Mrs. G had chronic headaches and a habitual reluctance to consume meat. His clinical examination revealed little; the patient had a well-tolerated fever, stable blood pressure and pulse, and no signs of severe sepsis. A neurological examination was unremarkable. The psychiatrist ordered immediate blood tests, including ammonia levels.

          <br><br>Within an hour, hyperammonemia was confirmed (224 μmol/liter, controls <50 μmol/liter), along with a respiratory alkalosis and a marked inflammatory syndrome. Results of liver function tests, as well as all the other blood tests, were normal. The psychiatrist contacted the internal medicine fellow, who confirmed the need for an immediate multidisciplinary management of a probable late-onset urea cycle disorder. He decided to transfer the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU), despite the reluctance of the obstetrical team, who felt that the patient should instead be in a secure psychiatric facility. In the ICU, an etiologic treatment of urea cycle disorder-induced hyperammonemia was immediately started under the guidance of a metabolic physician. It combined intravenous sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate (each at a loading dose of 10 g, then 2 g five times per day), citrulline (2 g five times per day), and protein-free hypercaloric nutrition delivered through a nasogastric tube. Antibiotic treatment was continued with co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin trihydrate and potassium clavulanate), and the differential diagnosis workup was completed. CT imaging of the brain was unremarkable. Blood and CSF cultures were sterile. During the night, the patient's neuropsychiatric status improved in conjunction with a drop in her ammonia level (her ammonia level fell to 64 μmol/liter the day after initiation of treatment and to 19 μmol/liter the following day). The diagnosis of urea cycle disorder was substantiated by plasma amino acid chromatography showing high glutamine-glutamate and low citrulline concentrations.

          <br><br>Within 5 days, this treatment yielded a complete and stable normalization of both Mrs. G's neuropsychiatric status and her ammonia plasma level. Weaned from antipsychotics and asymptomatic, she was discharged 13 days after the diagnosis of urea cycle disorder was made, with instructions for a protein-restricted diet and prescriptions for oral sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate, and citrulline. The diagnosis of urea cycle disorder was secondarily confirmed by molecular analysis. Ornithine transcarbamylase and N-acetyl glutamate synthase deficiency were ruled out. Carbamyl phosphate synthase (CPS) gene analysis found two mutations (p.P87S and p.R803C), confirming CPS1 deficiency.

          <br><br>Six months after discharge, Mrs. G remained free of psychiatric symptoms on a regimen of sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate, and citrulline (each at 2 g three times per day). Her cerebral MRI was unremarkable. However, neuropsychological tests revealed an IQ in the lower normal range (verbal IQ=77, performance IQ=84), restricted working memory, and mild attention deficit, which contrasted with the fact that she had worked as a journalist several years ago. Further investigations of Mrs. G's family history revealed that her mother had 11 pregnancies with six miscarriages. One boy died unexpectedly at 2 days of life and one girl died at age 4 after measles. Mrs. G's sister also had a postpartum acute confusion, and her brother, who is also reluctant to eat meat, had several episodes of acute ataxia associated with strange behaviors.
